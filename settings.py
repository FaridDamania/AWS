# 1. Build a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to allow users to upload images, process them (e.g., resize or apply filters), and then retrieve the processed images through the API Gateway. Provide step-by-step instructions for implementing this system.

# Ans :  

# Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
# Amazon S3 will be used to store the images you upload and the processed images.
# 1.	Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
# 2.	Click on "Create bucket".
# 3.	Provide a bucket name, select the AWS Region you want to create your bucket in, and keep all other settings as default for now.
# 4.	Click "Create bucket".
# Step 2: Create an IAM Role for Lambda
# AWS Lambda will need permissions to access S3 and other AWS services.
# 1.	Go to the IAM service in the AWS Management Console.
# 2.	Click on "Roles" on the left sidebar, then click "Create role".
# 3.	Select "AWS service" as the trusted entity and choose "Lambda" as the service that will use this role.
# 4.	Click "Next: Permissions".
# 5.	Attach policies like AmazonS3FullAccess and AWSLambdaExecute.
# 6.	Click "Next: Tags" and add any tags if needed.
# 7.	Click "Next: Review", give the role a name, and then "Create role".
# Step 3: Create a Lambda Function
# This function will be triggered to process the images.
# 1.	Go to the Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
# 2.	Click "Create function".
# 3.	Choose "Author from scratch".
# 4.	Enter a function name.
# 5.	Choose the latest supported Python version for the runtime.
# 6.	Select the IAM role you created earlier.
# 7.	Click "Create function".
# Step 4: Add Code to Lambda
# After creating the function, you'll need to add the code that processes the images.
# 1.	In your Lambda function page, you'll see an inline code editor.
# 2.	You can use the Python Pillow library to process images (e.g., resize or apply filters). However, since AWS Lambda doesn't have this library pre-installed, you'll need to create a deployment package with your code and any dependencies. There are detailed guides on how to do this, but the basic steps involve installing the dependencies locally, zipping them with your code, and then uploading the zip file to Lambda.
# Step 5: Set Lambda Triggers
# To process images when they are uploaded to S3:
# 1.	On your Lambda function's page, click on "Add trigger".
# 2.	Select S3 from the list of available triggers.
# 3.	Choose the S3 bucket you created.
# 4.	Set the event type to "PUT".
# 5.	Click "Add".
# Step 6: Create an API Gateway
# This will be the HTTP endpoint for users to upload and retrieve images.
# 1.	Go to the API Gateway service in the AWS Management Console.
# 2.	Click "Create API".
# 3.	Choose "REST API" and click "Build".
# 4.	Choose "New API" and give it a name.
# 5.	Click "Create API".
# Step 7: Set up API Methods
# For uploading images:
# 1.	In the API Gateway console, select your API.
# 2.	Create a new resource by clicking "Actions" and then "Create Resource".
# 3.	Enter a resource name and path (e.g., /upload).
# 4.	Click "Create Resource".
# 5.	With the new resource selected, click "Actions" and then "Create Method".
# 6.	Select "PUT" and click the checkmark.
# 7.	For the integration type, select "AWS Service".
# 8.	Choose S3 for AWS Service, PUT for HTTP method, and select the region where your S3 bucket is located.
# 9.	For "Action Type", choose "Use path override" and enter the object path in your bucket.
# 10.	Set up the method execution with the necessary request and response transformations.
# For retrieving images:
# 1.	Repeat the steps to create a new resource, e.g., /image.
# 2.	Create a GET method.
# 3.	Set the integration type to "AWS Service".
# 4.	Configure it similarly to the PUT method but with the GET HTTP method.
# Step 8: Deploy API
# To make the API accessible:
# 1.	Click on "Actions" and then "Deploy API".
# 2.	Select "[New Stage]" and give it a stage name (e.g., prod).
# 3.	Click "Deploy".
# You can now test uploading an image to your S3 bucket using the API Gateway's URL and retrieving processed images the same way.

# Lambda Function
# import boto3
# from PIL import Image
# import io

# s3_client = boto3.client('s3')

# def lambda_handler(event, context):
# 	bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
# 	key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
# 	size = (128, 128)

# 	# Get the object from the event
# 	response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key)
# 	image = Image.open(response['Body'])

# 	# Resize the image
# 	image.thumbnail(size)

# 	# Save the image to a buffer
# 	buffer = io.BytesIO()
# 	image.save(buffer, 'JPEG')
# 	buffer.seek(0)

# 	# Put the object back on S3
# 	new_key = f"resized-{key}"
# 	s3_client.put_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=new_key, Body=buffer, ContentType='image/jpeg')

# 	return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': json.dumps('Image processed successfully!')}
























































# 2.

Test the system's functionality using Postman.

# Ans : 

# Step 1: Set up Amazon DynamoDB
# 1.	Log in to the AWS Management Console and go to the Amazon DynamoDB service.
# 2.	Click on Create table.
# 3.	Name your table EmailSubscriptions and set the primary key to email as type String.
# 4.	Leave the default settings and click Create.
# Step 2: Set up AWS Lambda
# 1.	Go to AWS Lambda service and click on Create function.
# 2.	Choose an Author from scratch.
# 3.	Enter a name for your function, like SaveEmailSubscription.
# 4.	Choose a runtime (Node.js/Python), whichever you are more comfortable with.
# 5.	For permissions, create a new role with basic Lambda permissions or assign an existing role if you have one that fits.
# 6.	Click Create function.
# Lambda Function Code: Write a simple Lambda function that will take an email address from an API Gateway event and store it in the DynamoDB table.
# Here is a simple Node.js example:
# javascript
# const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
# const dynamoDB = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

# exports.handler = async (event) => {
#     let body;
#     let statusCode = '200';
#     const headers = {
#         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
#     };

#     try {
#         switch (event.httpMethod) {
#             case 'POST':
#                 let requestJSON = JSON.parse(event.body);
#                 await dynamoDB.put({
#                     TableName: "EmailSubscriptions",
#                     Item: {
#                         email: requestJSON.email
#                     }
#                 }).promise();
#                 body = `Put item ${requestJSON.email}`;
#                 break;
#             default:
#                 throw new Error(`Unsupported method "${event.httpMethod}"`);
#         }
#     } catch (err) {
#         statusCode = '400';
#         body = err.message;
#     } finally {
#         body = JSON.stringify(body);
#     }

#     return {
#         statusCode,
#         body,
#         headers
#     };
# };

# Step 3: Set up Amazon API Gateway
# 1.	Go to Amazon API Gateway and create a new API.
# 2.	Choose REST API and click on Build.
# 3.	On the new screen, choose New API and enter an API name, like EmailSubscriptionAPI.
# 4.	Leave the endpoint type as regional and click on Create API.
# 5.	Create a new resource (e.g., /subscribe) and a POST method for that resource.
# 6.	For the POST method integration, choose Lambda Function, and select the Lambda function you created earlier.
# 7.	Deploy the API by creating a new stage (e.g., prod).
# Step 4: Set up Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
# 1.	Go to Amazon SES and verify a new email address you will use to send confirmation emails.
# 2.	In Identity Management, click on Email Addresses and then Verify a New Email Address.
# 3.	Follow the instructions to verify your email address.
# You can then update your Lambda function to send an email using the verified address in SES when a new subscription is added.
# Step 5: Test with Postman
# 1.	Open Postman.
# 2.	Create a new request to test the API.
# 3.	Set the method to POST and paste the API endpoint URL you got when you deployed your API Gateway.
# 4.	Under Headers, set Content-Type to application/json.
# 5.	In the Body section, choose raw and enter a JSON object with the email you want to subscribe (e.g., {"email": "user@example.com"}).
# 6.	Send the request and check the response.





















































# 3. Design a serverless data aggregation and reporting system using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. Users should be able to submit data via the API Gateway, and a Lambda function should aggregate and store the data in Amazon Redshift or a similar data store.

# Step 3: Integrate Lambda with API Gateway
# 1.	Go back to your API in API Gateway.
# 2.	For each method (POST and GET), choose Integration type.
# 3.	Select Lambda Function and specify the corresponding Lambda function you created for each API method.
# 4.	Deploy the API again to ensure the integrations are live.
# Step 4: Set up the Data Store in Amazon Redshift
# 1.	Navigate to Amazon Redshift in the AWS Management Console.
# 2.	Click on Create cluster.
# 3.	Follow the setup process, including defining a cluster identifier, database name, database port, master username, and password.
# 4.	Configure your VPC settings, security groups, and IAM roles as required for access management.
# 5.	Click on Create cluster.
# 6.	Once the cluster is available, note down the endpoint details.
# Step 5: Modify the Lambda Function to Connect to Redshift
# 1.	Update the DataAggregator Lambda function to connect to the Redshift cluster using the endpoint details.
# 2.	Install any required database drivers and dependencies.
# 3.	Code the function to aggregate data and insert it into Redshift tables.
# 4.	For the ReportGenerator Lambda function, code the logic to retrieve aggregated data and format it as a report.
# Step 6: Testing and Validation
# 1.	Test the POST API to submit data and ensure it's being aggregated in Redshift.
# 2.	Test the GET API to retrieve reports and validate the data is accurate.
# Step 7: Monitoring and Logging
# 1.	Set up Amazon CloudWatch logs for both API Gateway and Lambda functions to monitor the operations.





















































# 4. Build a serverless URL shortening service using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. When users submit a long URL via the API Gateway, a Lambda function should generate a short URL and redirect users to the original URL when they access the short URL. Test the functionality using Postman.

# Ans : 

# Step 1: Designing the Lambda Function

# 1.	Create a new Lambda function:
# 2.	Go to the AWS Management Console.
# 3.	Navigate to the Lambda service.
# 4.	Click on "Create function".
# 5.	Choose "Author from scratch".
# 6.	Name your function (e.g., URLShortenerFunction).
# 7.	Select a runtime (Python 3.x or Node.js, for example).
# 8.	Choose or create a new role with basic Lambda permissions.
# Implement the function logic:
# Write a function to generate a short URL identifier (you can use a hash function or a random string generator).
# Store the mapping of the short identifier to the original URL. You can use AWS DynamoDB for persistence.
# Write another function that retrieves the original URL when given the short URL identifier.
# Step 2: Setting up the API Gateway

# 1.	Create a new API:
# 2.	Go to the AWS Management Console.
# 3.	Navigate to the API Gateway service.
# 4.	Click on "Create API".
# 5.	Choose "REST API" and then "Build".
# 6.	Fill in the API name (e.g., URLShortenerAPI) and endpoint type (choose "Regional").
# 7.	Click on "Create API".
# 8.	Define new resources and methods:
# 9.	Create a new resource (e.g., /shorten) for the URL shortening function.
# 10.	Define a POST method for the /shorten resource, and link it to the Lambda function you created.
# 11.	Create another resource (e.g., /{shortUrl}) for the redirect function.
# 12.	Define a GET method for the /{shortUrl} resource, and link it to the same Lambda function (the function will differentiate the behavior based on the HTTP method).

# Step 3: Integrating Lambda with DynamoDB

# 1.	Create a DynamoDB table:
# 2.	Go to the AWS Management Console.
# 3.	Navigate to the DynamoDB service.
# 4.	Click on "Create table".
# 5.	Name your table (e.g., URLMappings) and provide a primary key (e.g., shortId).
# 6.	Click on "Create".
# 7.	Update the Lambda execution role:
# 8.	Go to the IAM service.
# 9.	Find the execution role that your Lambda function is using.
# 10.	Attach policies that allow your Lambda function to read and write to the DynamoDB table you created.
# Step 4: Deploying the API

# Once your API methods are set up and connected to the Lambda function, deploy your API.
# In the API Gateway console, click on "Actions" and select "Deploy API".
# Create a new stage (e.g., prod) and deploy your API to this stage.

# Step 5: Testing with Postman
# 1.	Gather the invoke URL:
# 2.	After deployment, you will see an "Invoke URL" in the stage editor of the API Gateway.
# 3.	Copy this URL for use in Postman.
# 4.	Test the URL shortening:
# 5.	Open Postman.
# 6.	Create a new request to the {invokeURL}/shorten.
# 7.	Set it to POST and add the original URL in the request body.
# 8.	Send the request and you should receive a shortened URL.
# 9.	Test the redirection:
# 10.	Create another request to the {invokeURL}/{shortUrl}.
# 11.	Set it to GET.
# 12.	Sending this request should redirect you to the original URL.

# 5. You are tasked with designing a VPC in AWS, and you've chosen the CIDR block 172.31.0.0/16 for your private subnet. Calculate and provide the total number of available IP addresses in this CIDR block for your private subnet.

# Ans : 

# When you create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS and select a CIDR block, the number of available IP addresses is determined by the subnet mask. In your case, the subnet mask is /16, which corresponds to 65536 IP addresses in total because a /16 network has 16 bits for the network and 16 bits for host addresses.
# 2^(32-16) = 2^16 = 65536
# However, AWS reserves the first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet for internal networking purposes. This means that the actual number of usable IP addresses will be 65536 - 5 = 65531.























# 6. In your AWS VPC, you've allocated the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/20. Calculate the number of available IP addresses for both the public and private subnets if you plan to divide this CIDR into two equal-sized subnets.

# Ans : 

# A /20 CIDR block contains 232−20=212232−20=212 IP addresses, which is 4,096. When you split this into two equal-sized subnets, each subnet will use one additional bit for its subnet mask—going from /20 to /21.
# Let's calculate the number of available IP addresses for each /21 subnet:
# ●	A /21 subnet has 232−21=211232−21=211 IP addresses, which is 2,048.
# ●	AWS reserves the first four and the last IP address in each subnet for its own use (network address, VPC router, DNS, future use, and broadcast address, respectively). So, we have to subtract 5 from the total number of addresses for usable IPs in the subnet.
# So, for each /21 subnet, the number of usable IP addresses would be 2,048 - 5 = 2,043.
# Both the public and private subnets will have the same number of usable IP addresses since they are of equal size. Thus, each subnet will have 2,043 usable IP addresses.



















# 7. You are designing a network infrastructure for a company that requires three subnets for different purposes, each with unique CIDR blocks. Calculate and provide the total number of available IP addresses in each of the following CIDR blocks: 10.0.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/28, and 172.16.0.0/23.

# Ans : 

# The number of available IP addresses in a subnet can be calculated using the formula:
# Number of IP addresses=2(32−subnet mask)Number of IP addresses=2(32−subnet mask)
# However, typically in a subnet, 2 IP addresses are reserved: the network address and the broadcast address, which cannot be assigned to hosts. So the formula for the number of usable IP addresses is:
# Usable IP addresses=2(32−subnet mask)−2Usable IP addresses=2(32−subnet mask)−2
# Here's how to apply this formula to each CIDR block:
# 1.	10.0.0.0/24: The subnet mask is 24, so the calculation is 2(32−24)−2=28−2=256−22(32−24)−2=28−2=256−2.
# 2.	192.168.1.0/28: The subnet mask is 28, so the calculation is 2(32−28)−2=24−2=16−22(32−28)−2=24−2=16−2.
# 3.	172.16.0.0/23: The subnet mask is 23, so the calculation is 2(32−23)−2=29−2=512−22(32−23)−2=29−2=512−2.


# ●	10.0.0.0/24: 254 usable IP addresses
# ●	192.168.1.0/28: 14 usable IP addresses
# ●	172.16.0.0/23: 510 usable IP addresses





































# 8. You've been allocated a block of IP addresses in the format 203.0.113.0/24. Calculate and provide the total number of available IP addresses in this block. If you need to expand the range to accommodate more devices, what is the new CIDR block if you add an additional /25 subnet?

# Ans : 
# The CIDR notation /24 indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network part, leaving the remaining 8 bits for host addresses.
# For a /24 subnet:
# ●	The number of bits used for host addresses is 32−24=832−24=8 bits.
# ●	The number of available IP addresses is 28=25628=256.
# ●	However, two addresses are reserved within each subnet: one for the network address (all host bits are zero) and one for the broadcast address (all host bits are one). Therefore, the total number of usable IP addresses is 256−2=254256−2=254.
# Now, if you need to expand the range to accommodate more devices and you add an additional /25 subnet, you would be halving the original /24 subnet into two /25 subnets. This would mean:
# ●	The /25 subnet has 25 bits for the network part, leaving 7 bits for host addresses.
# ●	Each /25 subnet would have 27=12827=128 IP addresses.
# ●	As before, two addresses are reserved in each subnet for the network and broadcast addresses, leaving 128−2=126128−2=126 usable IP addresses per /25 subnet.
# Thus, by adding one /25 subnet to the original /24, you're effectively dividing the original subnet into two separate /25 subnets. The new CIDR blocks would be 203.0.113.0/25 for the first subnet and 203.0.113.128/25 for the second subnet, each with 126 usable IP addresses.
































# 9. You have multiple smaller CIDR blocks in the format 192.168.1.0/26, 192.168.1.64/26, and 192.168.1.128/26. Calculate and provide the total number of available IP addresses when these CIDR blocks are combined into a supernet.
# Ans : 

# Combining multiple CIDR blocks into a supernet involves creating a larger network that encompasses all the smaller networks. In this case, you have three /26 CIDR blocks. Let's first understand how many IP addresses are available in each /26 block.
# For a /26 subnet:
# ●	The number of bits used for host addresses is 32−26=632−26=6 bits.
# ●	The number of available IP addresses is 26=6426=64.
# ●	Similar to the /24 subnet, two addresses in each /26 subnet are reserved for the network address and the broadcast address, leaving 64−2=6264−2=62 usable IP addresses per /26 subnet.
# Since you have three /26 subnets, the total number of available IP addresses is the sum of usable IP addresses from all three subnets:
# 3×62=186 usable IP addresses3×62=186 usable IP addresses
# When combining these into a supernet, the supernet must start at the lowest address of the first block (192.168.1.0) and end at the highest address of the last block (192.168.1.191, since 192.168.1.128/26 spans from 192.168.1.128 to 192.168.1.191).
# If you combine these blocks, the new CIDR block will cover the range from 192.168.1.0 to at least 192.168.1.191. The combined range must fit within a CIDR block boundary that starts at 192.168.1.0. The /25 block goes from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.127, which is not enough to cover the third /26 block, so you need to expand to a /24 block, which covers 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255.
# So the supernet that combines these three /26 blocks would be 192.168.1.0/24, and it would have:
# ●	28=25628=256 IP addresses in total
# ●	256−2=254256−2=254 usable IP addresses, after accounting for the network and broadcast addresses.

# 11. You've implemented the order processing system, but your e-commerce website has experienced a sudden surge in orders. Explain how you can configure the components (Lambda, SQS, DynamoDB) to handle increased workload and ensure the system remains scalable and reliable.

# Ans : 

# AWS Lambda
# ●	Concurrency and Scaling: Increase the concurrency limit of your Lambda functions if they are close to reaching the current limit. You can request a limit increase if needed. Also, make sure your Lambda functions are stateless to enable scaling.
# ●	Memory and Timeout: Adjust the memory and timeout settings for your Lambda functions to ensure that they can handle more complex tasks or larger orders efficiently.
# ●	Error Handling: Implement proper error handling in your Lambda functions to deal with exceptions gracefully. This includes retries and dead-letter queues to handle failed invocations.
# ●	Cold Start Optimization: Reduce cold starts by keeping your functions warm if you're experiencing frequent scaling events, although this is less of an issue with newer Lambda versions.
# AWS SQS
# ●	Scaling: SQS scales automatically to handle any volume of messages, but you should monitor the number of messages in the queue to ensure that your system is processing messages as fast as they are being queued.
# ●	Visibility Timeout: Adjust the visibility timeout to make sure that messages are not being returned to the queue and processed multiple times if the Lambda functions need more time to process.
# ●	Dead-Letter Queues: Configure a dead-letter queue (DLQ) to capture messages that cannot be processed after several attempts. This will help you to isolate and debug problematic messages.
# ●	Batch Processing: If applicable, use batch processing to allow each Lambda invocation to process multiple messages from the queue, increasing throughput and reducing costs.
# AWS DynamoDB
# ●	Provisioned Throughput: Monitor your DynamoDB tables and consider switching to On-Demand capacity if you experience unpredictable workloads, or adjust your provisioned read/write capacity units if you are on the Provisioned mode.
# ●	Partitioning: Ensure that your table's partition key design supports the distribution of your workload evenly across all partitions. This prevents hot spots that can limit scalability.
# ●	DAX: For read-heavy applications, consider using DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) to cache read responses and reduce the load on your tables.
# ●	Auto Scaling: Enable DynamoDB auto-scaling to adjust the provisioned throughput automatically in response to actual traffic patterns.
# ●	Global Tables: If your e-commerce site operates in multiple regions, consider using DynamoDB Global Tables to provide fully replicated, multi-region tables.
